 * The Bellman-Ford algorithms computes single-source shortest paths in a weighted diagraph. 
 * The algorithm is named after its developers, Richard Bellman and Lester Ford, Jr. For graphs with non-negative weights, 
 * Dijkstra's algorithm solves the problem. The Bellman-Ford algorithm is used primarily for graphs with negative weights. 
 * The algorithm can detect negative cycles and report their existence, 
 * but it cannot produce a correct "shortest path" if a negative cycle is reachable from the source.
 * 
 * From Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance-vector_routing_protocol
 * 
 *  - The Bellmanâ€“Ford algorithm does not prevent routing loops from happening and suffers from the count-to-infinity problem.

 *
 * A negative cycle in the graph causes {@link ShortestPathAlgorithm.previous} array to contain cycles 
 * which causes produceResults method to get into an infinite loop.
